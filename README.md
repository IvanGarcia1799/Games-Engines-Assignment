# Games-Engines-Assignment

**Name:** Ivan Garcia

**Class Group:** DT228-4

**Project Name:** Rythm Fighter

**Description:** I will implement a 3D third person fighting game, which will use music and have a scoring system. The score is determined by how many objects you destroy, using punche, kicks or abilities. There will be music being played and on the screen you will be able to see an audio visualizer. If you attack during the high notes in the song, you will deal more damage, meaning you destroy more objects, thus getting a higher score. The aim is to match your attacks to the rythm of the song and deal as much damage as possible every attack. I will simply have the damage value be increased accordingly to the music being played.

I will be using the class notes but I have also looked into some videos to guide myself with.
